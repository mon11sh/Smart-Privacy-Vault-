# 🛡️ CanaraVeriGPT

Welcome to **CanaraVeriGPT** — a secure, smart, and simple data verification system powered by tokens and GPT intelligence! 🚀

---

## 🔍 What is This?

CanaraVeriGPT is a token-based data exchange platform built for **partners and users**. It lets:

- ✅ **Users** request and view tokens issued for their data.
- 🔐 **Partners** validate and redeem tokens to securely access verified user data.
- 🧠 Integrates GPT (or any AI logic layer you build!) for advanced insights.

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- ⚛️ **React** — clean frontend for users and partners
- 🐍 **Flask (Python)** — secure backend API
- 🗃️ **SQLite / PostgreSQL** — for storing users, tokens, data
- 🎨 **TailwindCSS** — for UI styling

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Users log in** - choose partner and grant consent for data acess.
2. **Partners** can log in to view available tokens.
3. They paste a `Token ID` and *redeem it* 🪙 to access secure data.
4. Status of tokens is shown — ✅ Valid, ❌ Revoked, ⌛ Expired.
5. Secure communication and token validation is done via backend.
